These guys need to see the whole picture in one place – how the system works at each level. Healthcare dashboard metrics allow them to track the performance of the 
hospital – both in terms of commercial efficiency (like costs and the number of admissions) and in terms of treatment success rates (LOS, diagnosis by department, etc.)

* Medical Staff *
Data analysis is critical in evidence-based medicine. Doctors are trained from clinical data. They are taught to analyze patient therapies based on data in medical books. 
So a single dashboard containing all patient data is a convenient tool to track the effectiveness of treatments and to compare the work of clinicians with their colleagues. This is an effective way to enhance clinician performance as well as patient satisfaction.
